# simulationgame
Welcome to the simulation game where you can simulate creatures and how they evolve!

The thought behind this repo so to create very simple evolution simulator, where creatures wake up, try to stay alive by competing for food, reproducing and mutating.

The aim is mostly to better myself in the language of Go, and programming in general rather than a perfect evolution simulator.
